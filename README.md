## The Why

This project was developed as a submission for the Mobile Development course at Thompson Rivers University, under the guidance of [Prof. Jaspreet Kaur](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dr-jaspreet-kaur-6a70a5220/). Throughout the development process, we utilized a diverse array of technologies and tools including Flutter, Firebase, Figma, and GitHub, along with various libraries that enhanced our application's functionality. We applied many of the concepts learned in the course, which significantly contributed to our comprehensive understanding and skill enhancement.
